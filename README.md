# Save Our Ship 2: Archotech Fall

*You are a once-great archotech, in past a human, albeit only briefly ascended on your home planet. However, there were forces so powerful that they could practically destroy you, and only your fragment could survive and urgently leave one of the artificial moons of your base planet, sinking into agony.
Now you have to survive on a harsh and cruel planet, and from your former power there is not even a shadow left, only a formgel - will you be able to?*

Scenario for SOS2 and HSK, telling the story of the fall of a once mighty archotech, who managed to save only a small fragment of his former mind after falling from forces so powerful that he was able to defeat the archotech.
There are two game options - on behalf of a human colonist and on behalf of the AI core. You start in a broken pod with an archotech spore and a worker droid, as well as a small nuclear generator with some fuel and two batteries.
